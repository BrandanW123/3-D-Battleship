# 3-D-Battleship

This repository is a automated game of Battleship however with a twist. The output displays where the ships are located on the board and the algorithm plays as to where the ships(s) are located. The program performs a Linear Search to find the ship(s) until all of the ship are found. The twist in all of this is instead of two boards, the program will try to find the battleship(s) among three boards.
